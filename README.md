# Base Code for Login - Register - Logout

This project provides a **basic implementation** of a login, registration, and logout using Java with Maven and MySQL. It leverages the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, similar to that used in Laravel.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Java JDK** (Java Development Kit) If not working, try using **Java version "22.0.1"**
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **MySQL** or **XAMPP** for the database
- **Preferred IDE - Apache Netbeans**

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, **clone this repository** to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Resaizu/Base-Code-Java-Maven.git
```
### Step 2: Set Up MySQL Connector
Download the MySQL Connector for Java (version 8.0.17) from:
[MySQL Connector/J 8.0.17 Archive](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/c-j/)

- Recommended Product Version: 8.0.17
- Operating System: Platform Independent
- Download the ZIP file
- Extract the ZIP file and add the .jar file to your projectâ€™s library or configure it in your IDE to include it in the build path.

### Step 3: Database Configuration
If using MySQL or XAMPP, ensure the MySQL service is running.
Create a new database named course_project, or use a database of your choice:
- If you choose a different database, update the connection settings in the Repository/Database > find "**course_project**" and replace it using your database name.

### Step 4: Import Project
Import the project into your preferred IDE that supports Maven projects (e.g., Apache Netbeans, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
